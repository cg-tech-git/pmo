 Product Requirements Document: PMO Application

 1\. Introduction

 1.1. Problem  
Managing a portfolio of complex projects involves juggling vast amounts of disconnected information across various domains like commercials, engineering, logistics, and human resources. Project managers and company leadership lack a centralized, real-time, and data-driven view of project status, risks, and performance. This fragmentation leads to inefficient resource allocation, cost overruns, schedule delays, and an inability to derive strategic insights from project data. Decision-making is often reactive, based on siloed, out-of-date information.

 1.2. Vision  
To create a single source of truth for all project-related activities within the company. The PMO application will empower teams with integrated, real-time data and intelligent analytics, transforming project management from a reactive, administrative function into a proactive, strategic driver of business success.

 1.3. Mission  
To provide a unified and intelligent platform that streamlines project management processes, enhances operational visibility, and delivers actionable insights to ensure projects are delivered on time, within budget, and to the highest standard of quality.

 1.4. Success Metrics (KPIs)  
 Adoption Rate: Percentage of active projects being managed through the PMO application.  
 Daily Active Users (DAU): Number of unique users logging in daily.  
 Task Completion Rate: Percentage of project tasks updated and closed within the platform.  
 Time to Generate Report: Average time taken for a user to generate a self-service report.
